<h2>CATEGORY: WEBSITE</h2>

<h3>"How do I see my website?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Your website is at [their domain]. You can also find it on your quick links page at [their domain]/my-links.</blockquote>

<h3>"How do I update my phone number on the website?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Let us know the new number and we'll update it for you within 24 hours. Reply with the new number and we'll take care of it.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Update custom values: <code>company_phone__aesthetic_</code>, <code>company_phone__functional_</code>, <code>company_twilio_phone</code>

<h3>"Can I change the text/images on my website?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Yes! For text changes, just tell us what you'd like changed and where. For images, send us the new images and we'll swap them out.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Fulfillment handles this. Create task in pipeline.

<h3>"My website isn't loading"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>I'll check on that right now. Can you tell me what you see when you try to visit it? Also, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Check: Domain DNS, SSL certificate, GHL site status. If actual issue → escalate to Fulfillment.

<h3>"The chat widget isn't working"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Let me check on that. Can you tell me what happens when you try to use it? I'll look into it right now.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Check: Chat widget enabled on site, correct configuration.

<hr>

<h2>CATEGORY: APP / LEAD CONNECTOR</h2>

<h3>"How do I download the app?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Here are the links:</blockquote>
<blockquote>- iPhone: https://apps.apple.com/app/highlevel/id1459516266</blockquote>
<blockquote>- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gohighlevel</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>After downloading, use your email and the password we set up. Let me know if you need help logging in.</blockquote>

<h3>"I can't log in to the app"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>No problem! I'll reset your password right now. Make sure the new password has at least one special character (like ! or @). I'll text you the new password in a moment.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Reset in GHL: Sub-account → Team → User → Reset password

<h3>"Where do I see my leads?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>In the app, tap "Conversations" at the bottom. All your leads show up there. You can also tap "Contacts" to see everyone in your system.</blockquote>

<h3>"How do I respond to leads?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>In the app, tap "Conversations", then tap on the lead's name. You can text them right from there. Just type your message and hit send.</blockquote>

<h3>"I'm not getting notifications"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Let's fix that. Go to your phone's Settings → Notifications → Lead Connector (or HighLevel). Make sure notifications are turned ON. Also check that "Do Not Disturb" isn't enabled.</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>CATEGORY: REVIEWS</h2>

<h3>"How do I get more reviews?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Use the marketing form in your app! Go to Marketing → Forms → "Request Review". Enter your customer's name and phone, hit send, and they'll get a link to leave a review. We recommend doing this right after you finish a job.</blockquote>

<h3>"Where do I find my review link?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Your Google review link is on your quick links page: [their domain]/my-links. You can also copy it and text it directly to customers.</blockquote>

<h3>"How does the review system work?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>When a customer clicks your review link:</blockquote>
<blockquote>- If they click 4-5 stars → they go straight to Google to leave a review</blockquote>
<blockquote>- If they click 1-3 stars → they go to a private feedback form</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>This protects your Google rating while still getting feedback from unhappy customers.</blockquote>

<h3>"Can I respond to Google reviews?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Yes! Our system automatically responds to positive reviews (4-5 stars) for you. If you want to respond to one personally, you can do that in your Google Business Profile.</blockquote>

<h3>"I got a negative review"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Sorry to hear that. If it's from a real customer, the best approach is to respond professionally and try to make it right. Would you like some help crafting a response?</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> If fake review, guide them on flagging it in Google.

<hr>

<h2>CATEGORY: PHONE / SMS</h2>

<h3>"My phone number isn't working"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Let me check on that. Can you tell me what's happening? Are calls not coming through, or is it texts?</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Check: Phone forwarding config, A2P status, number not suspended

<h3>"Texts aren't sending"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>This could be related to your A2P verification. Let me check the status. It usually takes 5-7 business days to get approved after we submit.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Check A2P status. If rejected → see a2p-submission.md

<h3>"What's A2P?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>A2P stands for Application-to-Person. It's a verification process required by phone carriers to send automated texts. We submit this for you, and it usually takes 5-7 business days to get approved.</blockquote>

<h3>"I'm getting spam calls"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, spam calls are an industry-wide issue. Your toll-free number is new, so it may get fewer spam calls than your personal number. You can also block specific numbers in the app.</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>CATEGORY: BILLING</h2>

<h3>"When is my next payment?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Let me check that for you. [Check Stripe] Your next payment is on [date].</blockquote>

<h3>"How do I update my credit card?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>I'll send you a link to your billing portal where you can update your card securely.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Send billing portal link from Stripe

<h3>"Can I get a receipt?"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Of course! I'll email you a receipt right now. What email should I send it to?</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Generate invoice/receipt in Stripe → Email to client

<h3>"I was charged wrong"</h3>

<strong>Note:</strong> ESCALATE to Founder. Do not handle billing disputes directly.

<strong>Say:</strong>
<blockquote>I want to make sure this is handled correctly. Let me have [Dan/Owner] look into this personally. He'll reach out to you today.</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>CATEGORY: CANCELLATION</h2>

<strong>Note:</strong> ALL cancellation requests → ESCALATE to Closer/Founder per cancellation-saves.md

<strong>Say:</strong>
<blockquote>I understand. Let me have [Dan/Owner] give you a call to discuss. We want to make sure we understand what's happening and see if there's anything we can do.</blockquote>

<strong>Never process a cancellation without a conversation.</strong>

<hr>

<h2>CATEGORY: TECHNICAL</h2>

<h3>"Something on my website looks wrong"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Can you send me a screenshot of what you're seeing? I'll take a look and get it fixed.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Create task for Fulfillment

<h3>"My form isn't working"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Let me test it right now. I'll submit a test and see if it comes through. One moment.</blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Test the form. If broken → escalate to Fulfillment.

<h3>"Links aren't working"</h3>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<blockquote>Can you tell me which link isn't working? I'll check it out and fix it.</blockquote>

<hr>

<ul><li>Use their first name</li>
<li>Be friendly and helpful</li>
<li>Keep it short and simple</li>
<li>Offer solutions, not excuses</li>
